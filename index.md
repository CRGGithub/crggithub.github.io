## New Developments: [The NWU-WRF: Online and Operational](http://www.lekwenaradar.co.za/143.160.8.22/wrf/wrf.html)

The Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) is an advanced, community
driven, and open source weather model that can be used for both operational
forecasting and meteorological research at a variety of scales. Along with The
NWU-Lekwena Radar, The NWU-WRF puts the North-West University Potchefstroom at
the forefront of numerical weather prediction research in Africa, as the only
university running an *in-house*, student driven operational weather radar and
an operational numerical weather prediction model. Read more about WRF on the
[official user page](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/).

# Disclaimer
The NWU-Lekwena Radar and The NWU-WRF is a test bed for students to learn and
develop creative solutions related to weather forecasting and now-casting. This
means that the radar and model can be switched off for maintenance or it could
be broken on purpose in the name of learning. The radar and model should not be
used as a tool to make any severe weather alerts as the South-African Weather
Service is the only credible institution to do this. The products created here
should only be viewed as a tool for the development of young scientists and
something interesting to look at.
